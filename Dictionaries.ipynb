      "This is a quick show-and-tell demo about how to use dictionaries in Python. This demo is not enough background to get you through the third problem on Assignment 3, however -- these are just additional examples to help you manage your way through a tutorial from *Learn Python the Hard Way* or some other source. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into that, if you are wondering how to insert text like this into an iPython notebook, look up at the menu bar. There is a pulldown menu to the left of where it says \"Cell Toolbar\". In that pulldown menu are several options for how you want to format a cell in this iPython notebook. For coding, you'll want to keep it at the default of \"code\". But you can also select headings, markdown, or plain text. The cell you are currently reading is Markdown. You can learn more about markdown [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Or you can always double-click on a cell like this and it will take you to the raw Markdown used to generate it. This is very handy for creating nicely-formatted Python notebooks. The same thing in a Sage notebook is accomplished by putting `%md` at the top of a cell and then typing, and then hitting shift-enter to evaluate the Markdown. \n",
