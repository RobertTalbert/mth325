#MTH 325 Assignment 3

##Instructions

This assignment is due by 11:59pm on Monday, January 27. Please review the rules on collaboration as given in the syllabus for this and all other assignments. 

##Problems

**Problem 1:** Below are several statements about matrix addition and multiplication. In a Sage notebook, investigate whether each one is true or false for all matrices that fit the description given. Then, decide whether each statement is true ALWAYS TRUE, ALWAYS FALSE, or SOMETIMES TRUE. If the answer is SOMETIMES TRUE, give an example of matrices in which the statement is true and an example in which the statement is false. If the answer is ALWAYS TRUE or ALWAYS FALSE, give one example illustrating that the statement is true or false, and then write an argument for why the statement is always true or always false. 

(a) For any two square matrices A and B of the same size, we have A + B = B + A. 

(b) For any three square matrices A, B, and C of the same size, we have A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.   

(c) For any two square matrices A and B of the same size, we have AB = BA. 

(d) For any three square matrices A,B,C of the same size, if AC = BC then A = B. 

(e) For any two square matrices A,B of the same size, (A+B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2. 

**NOTE**: Please give this problem first priority in your lab work for Wednesday, January 22. The exit ticket for that day's work will consist of questions asking about your work on this problem. 


**Problem 2:** This problem will give you practice working with defining Python **functions**. For any positive integer n, define the function H(n) by the following formula: 

![H function](function.png)

So for example, H(20) = 10 and H(5) = 16. Write a Python function called `problem2` that implements this mathematical function. 

For bonus credit: Write another Python function `problem2bc` that inputs a positive integer n and outputs a list that contains the values of n, H(n), H(H(n)), H(H(H(n))), and so on until the value being computed equals 1. That is, the list contains n followed by the values obtained by running n through the `problem2` function, then running the output of that calculation back through `problem2`, over and over again until you reach 1. For example, `problem2bc(5)` should output the list `[5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`. 

Mathematical question for your consideration, not to turn in unless you want: Does the list given by `problem2bc` *always* terminate with a 1? Can you prove it? 

**Problem 3:** This problem will give you practice with working with Python **dictionaries**, which will be how we implement mathematical relations in Python and Sage. Dictionaries are discussed in [Lesson 39 of LPTHW](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html). In addition to working through this lesson, or its equivalent in another tutorial, you should work through the brief dictionaries tutorial I have created on SageMath Cloud. You will do this by importing an iPython notebook into your SMC accounts. Follow these steps: 

+ Open up SMC and navigate to a project. 
+ Create a new file, and in the blank for the file name, put in this URL: https://github.com/RobertTalbert/mth325/blob/master/Dictionaries.ipynb . Then click "From Web". 
+ Click on the **Files** button and you should see a new iPython notebook called `Dictionaries` in your project folder. Open it up and follow the directions. 

We can implement social networks as a Python dictionary, as follows: Each person is a key, and the values associated with each key reside in a list of the people whom that person "likes". For example, here's a scaled-back version of the Bookface social network from the first day of class: 

| Person | Likes  | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| Alice  |  Bob, Chuck | 
| Bob    |  (nobody)   |
| Chuck  |  Alice      |
| Dave   |  Alice, Bob, Chuck | 

The dictionary associated to that network would be: 

` {'Alice' : ['Bob', 'Chuck'],  'Bob' : [ ], 'Chuck' : ['Alice'], 'Dave' : ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Chuck']}`

Notice that Bob's value is an empty list because he is in the network but doesn't like anybody. (Bob needs to work on his social skills.)

For this problem, write a Python function or script that does the following: 

+ The program prompts the user to enter a key (= name of a person in the network). 
+ Then the program asks the user for a comma-separated list of people that the person they just entered "likes". 
+ The program creates a dictionary entry for the key and associates that key value to the list of "likes" that the user entered. 
+ When the user opts to quit, the program returns a dictionary that models the social network. 

*Hints on this problem:*

+ The method `split` takes a string and returns a list with each "token" in the string as a list entry. Example: 




+ Check out [this entry on the Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop) about a certain kind of `while` loop that might be useful here.
